# Development Targets and Milestones

### [2021-08-17]

- [x] TBA Design Documentation Sharing (Weekly Meeting)

  > - Will wait for further instructions and will work on discussions on business use-cases for CES preparation.
  > - Shared shanghai motor show temperature device shipping cost. $1200(8000 Yuan)


### [2021-08-18]

- [ ] ★ConnectedSeatApiGesture Connection Testing

- [x] TBA Gesture Data Testing

  > - If python based direction is difficult to implement, directional data will be implemented in Unity C#
  > - Python based status are much better since it does not use windows[deques].

- [ ] TBA Gesture Data Deserialization

  > Confirm existing data deserialization first.

- [x] Gesture Data to ConnectedSeatApiGesture

- [x] How to Access ConnectedSeatApiGesture

  > Issue encountered, system is stopping when operating with two Azure Kinects set to 30fps.
  >
  > maximum is 15fps per azure kinect.



### [2021-08-19]

- [x] Provide Feedback to TBA about Gesture Shared [2021-08-17]

  - Test and Improve Direction of Shuriken and Push with updated config files(from TBJ)

  > TBA will continue developing the gesture directions using the Data Structure and temporary coordinates provided by TBJ.



- [x] Short meeting with Nick to get status update

  > TBA started business use-case discussion for CES2021 presentation
  >
  > TBA Nick Papa and Nick Flannery are exploring the shanghai motor show for modification feasibility.
  >
  > - TBA capability to modify contents
