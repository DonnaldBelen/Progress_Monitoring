magandang tanghali po sa inyong lahat
this is a historic moment for us all
i feel it deep within me you the people have spoken
and it is resounding when my call for unity stated to resonate with you
it did so because it echoed your yearnings, mirrored your sentiments and expressed your hopes for family
country and for a better future, that is why reverberated and amplified as it did
to deliver the biggest electoral mandate in the history of philippines democracy
by your vote you rejected the politics of division, i offended none of my rivals on this campaign
i listed instead to what they were saying and i so little incompatilibty with my own ideas about jobs
fair wages, personal safety and national strength and ending want in the land of plenty
i believe that if we but focus in the work at hand and the work that will come to hand.
we will go far under my watch, you believe that too.

at pinakinggan ko ang tinig ninyo na ang sinisigaw ay pagkakaisa pagkakaisa pagkakaisa
we will go further together than against each other pushing forward
not pulling each other back out of fear out of a missplaced sense of weakness
but we are the furthest from weak. the filipino diaspora flourishes even in the most inhospitable climbs
where they are valued for their quality
the changes we seek will benefit all and will short change no one,
i was not hte instrument of change, you were that you made it happen
i am now you picked me to be your servant to enable changes to benefit all
i fully understand the gravity of the responsibility that you put unto my shoulders
i do not take it lightly but I am ready for the task.

I will need your help I want to rely on it, but rest assured i do not predicate success
on the wide cooperation that is needed, i will get it done.
i once knew a man who saw what little had beed achieved since independence
in a land of people with the greatest potential for achievement and yet they were poor
but he got it done.
sometimes with the needed support sometimes without
so will it be with his son you will get no excuses from me.

i am here not to talk about the past
i am here to tell you about our future
a future of sufficiency even plenty of readily available ways
and means to get done what needs doing by you by me
we do not look back but ahead up the road that we must take
to a place better than the one we lost in the pandemic
gains made and lost opporunities missed well-laid plans superceeded by the pandemic
indeed ours was the fastest growing economy in asean
by we shall be again by radical change in the way must now work to recover what
we have lost and move on from there.

we face prospects of the spread of the war abroad of which we are totally blameless
we seek friendship with all but countries like ours will bear the brunt to it. and if the great powers
draw the wrong lessongs of the ongoing tragedy in ukrain the same  dark prospect of conflict will spread to 
our part of the world. yet there is more out there like going forward by new ways
of doing that the pandemic forces to adopt, a strongest resilience , quicker adaptability
they are our best prevention they are our best protection
quiet reflect in the rough and tumbled campaign of the breath and intensity we have never experienced
revealed some of them such as the willingness to listen despite the noise.
the hesitation to quarrel over differences and to never ever give up hope of reconciliation
these gave me the peace to ponder deepr there are hints of a road not taken
that could get us out here quicker to something better to something less fragile
there is also what you the people did to cope
but this time empowered by new techniques and new resources
you got by getting some of what you needed with a massive goverment help
and for this i thank my predecessor for the courage of his hard decisions but there is a way
to put more means and choices in your hands
i trust the Filipino.

imagine how much more you'd achieve if govermend backs up instead of dictating your decisions
always there to pick you up when you fall getting what you need to get past a problem
imagine if it invested in your self empowerement to bring it closer to taking on what ever challenges come
imagine a country that in almost every sense is you.
now imagine what you and government can achieve together we did it in the pandemic
we will do it again. but again i will not predicate my promise to you on your cooperation
you have your own lives to live your work to do and there to i will help
government will get as much done alone without requiring more from you
that is what government and public officials are for no excuses just deliver.

it was like that once upon a time, I did not talk much in this campaign i did not bother to think
of rebutting my rivals instead i searched for promising approaches better than the usual solutions
i listened to you i did not lecure you who has the biggest take in our success and forth coming state
of the nation will tell you exactly how we shall get this done. in this fresh chapter of our history i extend my hand
to all Filipinos come let is put our shoulders to the wheel and give that wheel a fast turn to repair and to rebuild
and to address challenges in new ways to provide what all Filipinos need to be all that we can
we are here to repair a hosue divided to make it whole and to stand strong again in the bayanihan way
expressive of our nature as filipinos we shall seek not scorn dialouge listen respectfully to counter reviews
be open to suggestions coming from hard thinking and unsparing judgement but always from us Filipinos
we can trust no one else when it comes to what is best for us past history has often
proven that solutions from outside divided us non deepened our understanding they
were always at our expense never forget we are Filipinos one nation one republic indivisible.
we resisted and never fail to defeat foreign attempts to breakup our country
in my father's watch his strongest critics had conceeded that so let us all be part of the solution
that we choose in that lies the power to get it done. always be open to differing views but ever united
in our chosen goal. nver hesitating to change it should it prove one thing that is how agile, resilient republics are
made our future we dicide today yesterday cannot make that decision anymore nor can tomorrow delay it
the sooner we start the surer and quicker the prospect of achieving our future.
