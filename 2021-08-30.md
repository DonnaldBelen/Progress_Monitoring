## Gesture Recognition Changes



#### Goal:

Gesture Development for TMC Coaster use-case.

1. more accurate gesture detection based from moox_detect_gesture

2. moving window less algorithm

3. 2 Azure Kinect camera with 30fps. (wide field of view setting)

   Error(Crash) - when 2 Cameras are active.

   2 camera (30fps): Error

   2 camera (15fps): OK!

   3 camera (8fps): OK!

4. Gestures without FSM Playmaker



1. Docker Upgrade

   Dashing -> Foxy

2. folder naming

   moox_ -> cs_

   - type & no -> no longer used.

3. new docker

   control_pc

4. code execution method for environment setup

   ```
   docker start control_pc
   docker attach control_pc
   cd toyota_boshoku/src
   source ros2_cs_module_install_rebuild.sh
   ```

5. main python file

   ``` 
   python3 cs_control_pc.py
   ```

   



#### Other changes:

1.) cs_detect_gesture

- act_hand_push.py and act_hand_shuriken.py no longer uses windows
- pyrr module is now used to determine directional values.



#### Calibration Process:
