# Other To Do list:

- Create list of difficult points of development.

#### Difficult Points:

1.) ICP Calibration

- Actual environment is not yet available. re-calibration will be necessary.
- Re-tuning of gestures will be needed after re-calibration.





- [x] Create Repository for Azure Kinect Branch of Source
- [x] CSV controlled Relax/Therapy Visualization
- [x] Add map to the Woven Alpha Project
- [x] Change Moox Prefab to E-Palette
